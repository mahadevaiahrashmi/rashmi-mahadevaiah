        Teach Your AI Coding Helper Three Different Voices

        The idea in one paragraph
      </PostH2>
      <PostP>
        AI coding assistants that run in your terminal — like <strong>Claude Code</strong> (from Anthropic), <strong>Gemini CLI</strong> (from Google), and <strong>Codex CLI</strong> (from OpenAI) — are basically "chat with an AI that can also read and write the files on your laptop." A useful feature Anthropic shipped early is a <em>voice switcher</em>: a single command lets you tell Claude "just do it, no chatter" or "explain your thinking as you go" or "teach me — make me write the code myself." The other two tools don't ship this feature by default. The good news: you can add it yourself in about five minutes of copy-paste. This post shows you how, in plain language.
      </PostP>

      <PostH2>
        What are these three voices?
      </PostH2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-90 mb-4 font-serif">
        Claude Code calls them <em>output styles</em>. Here's what the menu looks like inside Claude Code:
      </p>
      <ClaudeCodeBlock title="Output style" plain noLineNumbers>
{`1. Default     Claude completes coding tasks efficiently and provides concise responses
2. Explanatory Claude explains its implementation choices and codebase patterns
3. Learning    Claude pauses and asks you to write small pieces of code for hands-on practice`}
      </ClaudeCodeBlock>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-90 mb-4 font-serif">
        Think of these as three moods you can put your helper in, depending on what you're doing:
      </p>
      <PostUL>
        <li><strong>Default</strong> — the quick, efficient mode. You say "add dark mode to the settings page"; it adds dark mode. Minimal chatter. Best when you know exactly what you want and just need it done.</li>
        <li><strong>Explanatory</strong> — the thoughtful colleague mode. Same task, but the helper explains <em>why</em> it picked a particular approach, what trade-offs matter, and how the change fits the rest of the codebase. Best when you're learning a new project or reviewing unfamiliar code.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning</strong> — the patient tutor mode. The helper breaks the task into bite-sized pieces, explains one piece, then <em>stops</em> and asks you to write that piece yourself. It reviews your attempt and guides you to the next step. Best when you want to genuinely improve your skills, not just get the job done.</li>
      </PostUL>
      <PostP>
        Inside Claude Code you switch modes with <InlineCode>/output-style explanatory</InlineCode> (or similar). Gemini and Codex don't have a button like this. So what we're going to do is create our own version — three little "presets" you can summon with a short command.

        Set it up in Gemini CLI
      </PostH2>
      <PostP>
        Gemini CLI has a really handy feature: you can invent your own <strong>slash commands</strong>. <InlineCode>/explain</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>/learn</InlineCode> don't exist by default — but after this setup, they will, and they'll do exactly what their names suggest.
      </PostP>
      <PostP>
        Each command lives as a small file in a folder Gemini watches. The file just holds a short note saying "when this command is used, behave this way." No programming, no bash. Ready? Open your terminal and follow along.
      </PostP>

      <PostH3>Step 1 — Make the folder where commands live</PostH3>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-90 mb-4 font-serif">
        Copy-paste this and press Enter. It creates an empty folder inside your home directory called <InlineCode>.gemini/commands</InlineCode>:
      </p>
      <ClaudeCodeBlock title="create the folder">{`mkdir -p ~/.gemini/commands`}</ClaudeCodeBlock>

      <PostH3>Step 2 — Create three tiny files, one per voice</PostH3>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-90 mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">Each file is a few lines of plain text. Create them one at a time in any text editor (VS Code, TextEdit, Notepad — anything). Save each one into the folder you just made, with the exact filename shown below.</p>

        What is <InlineCode>{"{{args}}"}</InlineCode>? It's a placeholder. Whatever you type after the command name gets slotted in. So typing <InlineCode>/explain refactor the login page</InlineCode> sends your task ("refactor the login page") into that slot, and the voice preset wraps around it.

      <PostH3>Step 3 — Try them out</PostH3>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-90 mb-4 font-serif">
        Start Gemini CLI (just type <InlineCode>gemini</InlineCode>) and try any of these:

      <PostP>
        That's it — you now have three voices. Switch anytime mid-conversation. If a command is unrecognised, type <InlineCode>/commands reload</InlineCode> to make Gemini pick up the new files.

      <PostH2>
        Set it up in Codex CLI
      </PostH2>
      <PostP>
        Codex CLI takes a slightly different approach: instead of slash commands, it has <strong>profiles</strong>. A profile is a named bundle of settings — think of it like switching between "work email" and "personal email" on your phone. We'll create three profiles, one per voice, and switch between them with a flag.
      </PostP>

      <PostH3>Step 1 — Edit Codex's settings file</PostH3>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-90 mb-4 font-serif">
        Codex keeps its settings in <InlineCode>~/.codex/config.toml</InlineCode>. If the file doesn't exist yet, create it. Open it in a text editor and paste this in:
      </p>
      <ClaudeCodeBlock title="config.toml">
{`[profiles.default]
personality = "pragmatic"
approval_mode = "auto"

[profiles.explanatory]
personality = "friendly"
approval_mode = "auto"

[profiles.learning]
personality = "friendly"
approval_mode = "read-only"`}
      </ClaudeCodeBlock>

      <PostP>
        What you just did: told Codex "here are three named setups." <InlineCode>personality</InlineCode> controls the tone. <InlineCode>approval_mode</InlineCode> controls whether Codex auto-applies changes (<InlineCode>auto</InlineCode>) or only suggests them (<InlineCode>read-only</InlineCode>). The learning profile uses <InlineCode>read-only</InlineCode> on purpose — you're the one writing code in that mode, not Codex.
      </PostP>

      <PostH3>Step 2 — Add the "how to behave" notes per project</PostH3>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-90 mb-4 font-serif">Profiles set the tone, but we also want Codex to follow specific instructions in each mode. Codex reads a file called <InlineCode>AGENTS.md</InlineCode> from your project folder and treats it like a standing brief.

          <li>Want it to feel closest to Claude Code? <strong>Gemini CLI</strong> — the slash commands behave almost identically.</li>
          <li>Already use ChatGPT or prefer OpenAI? <strong>Codex CLI</strong> — the profile system is simple and robust.</li>
          <li>Genuinely learning, not just getting a task done? Both work; Gemini tends to feel a little more teacher-like in Learning mode.</li>

            <li><strong>"Command not recognised."</strong> First, run <InlineCode>/commands reload</InlineCode> inside Gemini. If that doesn't work, your version may want commands under <InlineCode>~/.config/gemini/commands/</InlineCode> instead of <InlineCode>~/.gemini/commands/</InlineCode> — check which folder exists on your system.</li>
            <li><strong>Running on Windows?</strong> The setup script uses Unix-style file-creation tricks. Run it inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Git Bash. In plain PowerShell it won't work.</li>
            <li><strong>"Permission denied" when running the script.</strong> Add <InlineCode>bash </InlineCode> at the start: <InlineCode>bash setup-cli-styles.sh</InlineCode>. That avoids needing to mark the file executable.</li>

            <li><strong>Profile seems to be ignored.</strong> Open <InlineCode>~/.codex/config.toml</InlineCode> and double-check there are no missing quote marks or stray characters. Every setting needs quotes around the value.</li>
            <li><strong>AGENTS.md not picked up.</strong> Make sure the file sits in the top folder of your project (the same folder your code lives in), and that it's named exactly <InlineCode>AGENTS.md</InlineCode> with that capitalisation.</li>
            <li><strong>"Read-only" mode doesn't exist.</strong> Older Codex versions call it <InlineCode>ask</InlineCode>. If <InlineCode>"read-only"</InlineCode> throws an error, change it to <InlineCode>"ask"</InlineCode>.</li>

        That's it — you've got three voices

        Claude Code got this feature first, but after a few minutes of setup, Gemini and Codex match it. The real benefit isn't the feature itself — it's the reminder that these tools are genuinely customisable. You're not locked into whatever mood the vendor decided was the default. If you want your coding helper to pause and teach you, just tell it to. Save that instruction as a command or a profile, and never re-type it.

        Start in whichever voice fits today's task, switch when the task changes. The whole point of a voice switcher is that no single voice is right all the time.
